## Chile Fictive Trip (Nov 2026 – Jan 2027)
This repository contains a fictive solo trip plan to Chile created with OpenClaw sub‑agents.

**Files**
- `chili-trip-plan.md` — detailed written itinerary and logic.
- `chili-trip-calendar.ics` — calendar by trip stages (Google/Apple import) with **CLP** budget estimates per stage.

**How to import the calendar**
1. Google Calendar → Settings → *Import & export* → *Import*.
2. Select `chili-trip-calendar.ics`.

> Note: dates are illustrative and can be shifted; prices are plausible estimates in CLP.
